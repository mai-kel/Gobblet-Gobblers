<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1" data-line-end="2">This project
    allows to play tic-tac-toe like game Gobblet Gobblers. The main purpose of
    the game is to stack your pieces in one line, however in Gobblet Gobblers
    bigger pieces can be placed over the smaller ones, and pieces that were
    placed on the board can be moved again. These differences are making
    Gobblets much more interesting and difficult than tic-tac-toe. Project was made
    as an assignment for one of the courses during studies.</p>
